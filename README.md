# Heart-Disease-Detection-
A logistic regression model which classifies heart diseases 

# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction with Logistic Regression

This project uses the UCI Heart Disease (Cleveland) dataset to build a binary classification model using logistic regression. The model predicts whether a patient has heart disease based on various medical attributes.

## 📁 Dataset

- **Source**: [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+Disease)
- **File**: `processed.cleveland.data`
- **Target Variable**: `target`  
  - `0` = no heart disease  
  - `1` = presence of heart disease (any value > 0 is converted to 1)
